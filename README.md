## 💡 Why Gnoke Station?

Traditional embedded UI development is slow, costly, and hardware-specific. Gnoke Station eliminates complexity by leveraging the browser as the runtime.

| Metric | Traditional Embedded Development | **Gnoke Station Integration** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost** | **$50K–$200K** | **$5K–$15K** (Frontend) |
| **Timeline** | 6–18 months | **2–8 weeks** |
| **Team** | Specialized embedded engineers |  System Architects & Frontend Devs |

**Key Insight:** Gnoke Station provides a complete, professional frontend UI. Your team can now connect to hardware **directly via the browser** using modern Web APIs, or use a HAL backend only when strictly necessary.
