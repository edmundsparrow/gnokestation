## 💡 Why Unity Station?
Traditional embedded UI development is slow, costly, and hardware-specific.  
Unity Station eliminates complexity by leveraging the browser as the runtime.

- **Traditional Embedded Development**: $50K–$200K, 6–18 months, requires specialized teams.  
- **Unity Station Integration**: $5K–$15K, 2–8 weeks, web developers can contribute.

Every device with a display already has a browser — Unity Station lets you use it instead of reinventing the stack.
